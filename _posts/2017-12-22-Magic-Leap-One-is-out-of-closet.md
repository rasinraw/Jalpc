Finally HoloLens now has its long awaited competition which is thankfully not a vapourware. 'Magic Leap One' is out of closet.

For the uninitiated, this is about a secretive startup called **Magic Leap.** Which has got almost 2 Billion dollars funding from Google, Alibaba et al. with no real product for a long time (hence almost termed as [vapourware][1] by many).

This wednesday, Magic Leap announced their first mixed reality headset called ['Magic Leap One™, Creator Edition.’][2] targeted at developers/creators to build Apps for their ecosystem. SDK is expected in 2018 (this was promised 3 years back!). Meanwhile, Microsoft is already ahead in game with their [‘HoloLens Commercial Suite’][3] out in market and several business case studies under their belt. However, Magic Leap has promised cinematic quality mix reality... which is very promising, but yet to be seen in (mix) reality.

Rony Abovitz (CEO, Magic Leap) is on right track by focusing on low hanging fruit of ‘Indoor MR’ first rather than going for more complex out door scenarios in this release. However, it’s to be seen how his deliberate design decision for having a tethered 'puck' turns out (where HoloLens is completely untethered). Having real time computer vision, machine learning and distributed computing architecture locally would require that maximum CPU/GPU power possible in your pocket (something similar to what Apple does with their iPhone X A11 Bionic chip for processing [On-device Deep Neural Network for Face Detection][5]). He is okay to delay the untethered version for later and focus on best experience first.

And this is what I like about Rony’s vision - his Steve Jobs like thought process of prioritizing user experience over being first/fast to launch something, patience for waiting years till product is ready for mainstream and not forgetting the human factor (remember Google Glass?).

This is what Rony said in an [interview with TIME][4] on Wednesday:

_“Our theory is that in the next decade, people will value relationships, connecting with each other, [and] good life experiences over data, information, and even possessions,”_ 

PS: 

It's interesting to note _'Day 1'_ in their  WTDO ('Welcome to Day 1') campaign. Reminds of [Jeff Bezos 1997 Letter to Shareholders][6] where he mentioned about 'Day 1' philosophy  

_"But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets."_

And in [2016 Letter to Shareholders][7] he explained why its always Day 1 at Amazon and how to keep a company agile like at the Day 1...

_“Jeff, what does Day 2 look like?”_

_That’s a question I just got at our most recent all-hands meeting. I’ve been reminding people that it’s Day 1 for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic._

_“Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.”_

And while we are at it, I'd like to end this post with one last quote from this letter. The Holy Grail of Ethical Business - customer/people focus

_"There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here’s the big one: customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don’t yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf. No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it"_
